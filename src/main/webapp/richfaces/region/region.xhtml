	<p><b>a4j:region</b> component designed for marking zones which
	should be processed during Ajax requests without using execute
	definitions at Ajax behaviors/components. This allow to decouple the
	processing definitions from components id's and use declarative
	wrapping by this tag instead.</p>
	<p>In <b>RichFaces 3.3</b> all the view was processed if no regions
	specified as <b>ViewRoot itself was region by default</b>. And in <b>RichFaces
	4.x</b> - all the controls has <b>execute="@this" by default</b> according
	to JSF 2 specifications. But if the <b>controls wrapped with
	a4j:region</b> component and has no execute definitions - them uses<b>
	execute="@region"</b></p>
	<p>Look to the simple example below. There are two similar user
	info panels. But the <b><u>button inside the first panel will not works</u> </b>as not uses execute
	declarations and by default execut equals to @this. Separate definition needed to start working properly.
	And the <b>second panel inputs
	just wrapped to region with the commandButton and works</b> without any additional execute definitions.</p>
