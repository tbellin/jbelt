	<p><b>rich:dropDownMenu</b> is a component that allows to organize
	the hierarchical menu similar to one that almost every desktop
	application has.</p>
	<ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
	<ui:include src="/templates/includes/source-view.xhtml">
		<ui:param name="src" value="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
		<ui:param name="sourceType" value="xhtml" />
		<ui:param name="openLabel" value="View Source" />
		<ui:param name="hideLabel" value="Hide Source" />
	</ui:include>
	<p>The drop-down menu has a label that always appears on the page
	and invisible panel that appears with a particular client side event (<i>mouseover,
	click etc</i>). The event is defined with an <b>showEvent</b> attribute.</p>
	<p>Drop-down menu can contains a set of menuItem's, menuGroup's and
	menuSeparator's. Group plays a role of label for secondary levels on
	the menu. Separator is represented with horizontal lines between the
	items or groups. An item is an active element that might produce Ajax
	or non-Ajax requests. The submission mode is defined with <b>mode</b>
	attribute of the menu that has three possible options - "<i>server</i>",
	"<i>ajax</i>" or "<i>client</i>". Mode "<i>client</i>" does not produce
	any request, but allows you to provide your own functionality inside
	the menu item with an inline content. Mode could be overriden for
	concrete item</p>
